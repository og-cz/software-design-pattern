# **Each Creational Pattern = same goal, different *style* of creation**

Creational patterns all follow the same principle: they create objects in different structured ways without using new directly, so the code becomes flexible and loosely-coupled.

Here’s the simplest map:

### **1. Factory Method**

> Let subclasses decide what object is created.
> 

### **2. Abstract Factory**

> Create families of related objects.
> 

### **3. Builder**

> Create complex objects step-by-step.
> 

### **4. Prototype**

> Create new objects by cloning an existing object.
> 

### **5. Singleton**
> Ensure only one instance exists.
