# Software Design Pattern

This repository contains a collection of lessons, explanations, and examples covering the different software design patterns across the three categories. Each folder or file represents a specific design pattern, its purpose, how it works, and when to use it.

Use this repo as a learning guide or reference for understanding and applying design patterns in real-world projects.

### About

Software design patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common problems in software development. They provide a standardized way to structure code, making software more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand. Instead of reinventing the wheel, developers apply patterns to solve recurring design challenges with clarity and efficiency.

Design patterns are grouped into three major categories:

### Creational Patterns

Focus on how objects are created and managed. They help control object creation to make systems more flexible and efficient.

### Structural Patterns

Define how classes and objects are combined to form larger structures, improving flexibility and simplifying relationships between components.

### Behavioral Patterns

Describe how objects communicate, collaborate, and distribute responsibilities, ensuring smooth interaction within the system.

Design patterns are not strict rules, but guidelines and templates that help developers architect high-quality software.
