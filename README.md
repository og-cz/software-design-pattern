# Software Design Pattern

This repository contains a curated collection of lessons, explanations, and examples covering the major software design patterns. Each folder or file introduces a specific pattern, its purpose, how it works, and practical scenarios where it should be used.

Use this repository as a learning guide or reference for understanding and applying design patterns in real-world software projects.

### About

Software design patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software architecture and development.
They provide standardized ways to structure code, helping developers write software that is:

Maintainable – easy to modify and improve

Scalable – grows without introducing complexity

Understandable – cleaner and easier to reason about

Flexible – resistant to breaking changes

Instead of reinventing solutions, developers apply patterns to address recurring design challenges with consistency and clarity.

### Creational Patterns

These patterns deal with object creation.
They provide flexible, controlled, and efficient ways to construct objects without tightly coupling code to concrete classes.

### Structural Patterns

These patterns define how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
They help simplify relationships, reduce complexity, and improve flexibility between components.

### Behavioral Patterns

These patterns focus on communication and responsibility between objects.
They describe how objects collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks within the system.
